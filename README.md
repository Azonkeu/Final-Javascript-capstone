# Javascript-capstone

The JavaScript capstone project is about building your own web application based on an external API. We selected an API that provides movies. The webapp has 3 user interfaces:

- A home page showing a list of movies that you can "like."
- A popup window with more data about a movie that you can use to comment on it or reserve it for a period of time.

### General requirements

- Set up the repository on GitHub and use [Gitflow](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-transversal-skills/blob/main/git-github/articles/gitflow.md).
- Set up [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/guides/getting-started/#basic-setup).
- Set up a JavaScript testing library ([Jest](https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started)).
