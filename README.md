# Javascript-capstone

Our JavaScript capstone project is about building a website that shows the most popular movies from an API with the ability to comment and make reservations on each movie. The webapp has 3 user interfaces:


- A home page showing a list of movies that you can "like."
- A popup window with more data about a movie that you can use to comment on it
- A popup window with more data about a movie that you can use to reserve it for a period of time.


### General requirements

- Set up the repository on GitHub and use [Gitflow](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-transversal-skills/blob/main/git-github/articles/gitflow.md).
- Set up [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/guides/getting-started/#basic-setup).
- Set up a JavaScript testing library ([Jest](https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started)).
- We selected a movie api 


## Getting Started

After creating the repository on Github, we followed these steps:
- Cloned the repository on the local machine
- Created a **develop** branch and pushed it to Github
- Changed the default branch on Github (changed it from **main** to **develop**)
- Switched to the develop branch
- Created a feature branch with a descriptive name
- Switched to the new branch
- Set up linters
- Set up Webpack
- Set up Jest
- Chose the external Api
- Created an app using the involvement Api
- Wrote the code and pushed the branch to Github
- Created a pull request from the new feature branch into the **develop** branch
- When the work was completed, we created a pull request from the develop branch into the main branch.
