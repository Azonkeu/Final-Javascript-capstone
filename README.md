# Javascript-capstone

The JavaScript capstone project is about building your own web application based on an external API. You will select an API that provides data about a topic that you like and then build the webapp around it. The webapp will have 2 or 3 user interfaces (depending on the size of your team):

- A home page showing a list of items that you can "like."
- A popup window with more data about an item that you can use to comment on it or reserve it for a period of time.

### General requirements

- Make sure that there are [no linter errors](https://github.com/microverseinc/linters-config).

- Make sure that you used correct [Gitflow](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-transversal-skills/blob/main/git-github/articles/gitflow.md).
